# Laser Red - Vega Front-end Test

![App Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## About The Project

This project was developed as a **Gutenberg WordPress front-end technical test for Laser Red** ([laser.red](https://laser.red)).

## Why Not Directly in Gutenberg?

Every system should first be developed in isolation before being implemented in the WordPress backend to minimize mistakes, reduce friction, and avoid unnecessary rework.

A system that can power an entire website starts with modularity. Once a modular front-end foundation is built, integrating it into WordPress is mostly a matter of connecting React props to Gutenberg attributes.
If the props are designed incorrectly or inconsistently, implementing them in the backend becomes inefficient and error-prone ‚Äî resulting in wasted time and duplicated effort.

The focus of this project is to build a scalable and modular system that can be seamlessly integrated into WordPress with Gutenberg. Unlike a standard React application, the structure needs to be well-separated and carefully composed to function correctly as independent Gutenberg blocks. The placement of `<div>` elements and the organization of styles play a crucial role in ensuring proper structure, maintainability, and theme compatibility.

> **Note:** While the project is built in **Next.js** for convenience, no Next.js-specific functions are used for Gutenberg integration. For example, a custom `<Image>` component is used instead of Next.js‚Äôs `<Image>` because Gutenberg does not support it. I personally prefer building in Next.js for development speed, but the code is structured so it can be easily translated into Gutenberg blocks.

## Project Details

Test files can be found in the root folder ["/source"](https://github.com/AurelianSpodarec/laser-vega-front-end/tree/main/source).

Some minor design details have been adjusted due to the nature and constraints of technical tests in general.

Without the opportunity to clarify certain aspects with a designer, I made reasonable assumptions on spacing and layout to keep the project functional and coherent.

**Example:**  
Section **spacing values** (top/bottom) in the design included 120px, 115px, 105px, and 95px. Ideally, a system would be defined to simplify this. For maintainability, 115px and 120px could be merged into 120px, and 105px and 95px into 100px. The visual difference is subtle and barely noticeable, but it makes the codebase much more consistent, maintainable, and efficient.

That section is very close ‚Äî clean, clear, and professional.
Here‚Äôs a **polished version** with improved grammar, consistency, and small formatting fixes to make it read like production-grade documentation üëá

## Tooling

### Husky

This project uses [**Husky**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) to **automate Git hooks** (like `pre-commit` and `pre-push`), ensuring code quality and consistency before changes are committed or pushed.

---

#### Pre-commit Hooks

When you make a commit, Husky automatically runs quality checks such as **linting** and **type checking** to prevent bad code from entering the repository.

Husky hooks are stored in the project‚Äôs **`.husky/`** folder.

---

#### Skipping Checks

If you‚Äôre confident in your changes and need to **bypass Husky temporarily**, you can skip hook verification by adding the `--no-verify` flag:

```bash
git commit -m "chore: change text color" --no-verify
```

You can also skip checks on push:

```bash
git push --no-verify
```

> Use this only when you‚Äôre absolutely sure your code is safe to commit or push ‚Äî bypassing Husky disables all automated quality checks for that action.

## Conventions

### Images

When adding new images, include **today‚Äôs date** in the filename.
This helps with **version tracking** ‚Äî especially if a file with the same name is updated or replaced in the future.

**Format:**

```
image-name__YYYYMMDD
```

**Example:**

```
it-professional-standing__20251014.jpg;
```

### Naming Files & Components

For this project, files are named based on **what they are first**, followed by **their context or variation**.
This pattern improves discoverability and consistency across the codebase.

**Example:**

```
card-blog
button-primary
card-secondary
```

This approach:

- Groups related files logically in your IDE (e.g., all `card-*` components appear together).
- Reduces cognitive load ‚Äî if you forget the specific variant (e.g., ‚Äúblog‚Äù), you can type the shared prefix (`card`) and quickly find what you need.
- Makes scanning the file tree easier and more predictable.

## TypeScript Naming Convention

To improve **IDE discoverability** and reduce **cognitive load**, every TypeScript `type` or `interface` is prefixed with an **`I`** ‚Äî regardless of whether it‚Äôs declared as a `type` or an `interface`.

### Why this helps

- You don‚Äôt always remember whether a shape was defined as a `type` or an `interface`.
- There‚Äôs no strict rule on when to use one over the other.
- A consistent prefix (`I`) makes it easier to **search**, **autocomplete**, and **recognize** these structures in your codebase.

### Example

```ts
type IOverlayPosition = "center" | "top-left" | "bottom-right";

interface IImageContainerProps {
  // ...
}
```
